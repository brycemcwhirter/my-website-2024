I got this one from Ali Abdaal and it has been tremendously helpful.



Time is the great finite resource. You are constantly losing it. Once you run out, you can't get anymore. Every second is a reminder that your time on this earth is running out.

So how are you using it? What are you doing right now? Is it serving you or hindering you? Are you growing or diminishing?

The problem isn't that we don't have time. The problem is we're not using our time well.

So how can we fix this? We need a plan. A strategy. A playbook. A routine.

I got this idea from Ali Abdaal, a productivity genius I found on YouTube. You can check out his channel [**here.**](https://www.youtube.com/@aliabdaal)

The ideal calendar is a schedule that highlights your ideal week. The purpose of this calendar is not just to hold your weekly schedule, but it's to show the holes in your schedule where you have pockets of time.

I won't go through the trouble explaining it, as I believe Ali does a great job explaining it in this video [**here.**](https://youtu.be/6o2tm00Ar8A?si=T_9rc0-fXjKBrDmD&t=395).

After implementing this in my life, I became more disciplined. I had a plan for every hour of the day. The habits that I've always wanted to implement, I got the chance to because I scheduled it out. I'm able to schedule my morning run, time for reading, time for music creation, time for personal web development, etc. It's been such a benefit to have in my life.

Quick reminder, this calendar is *ideal*. Meaning, some days you don't fully stick with it. Life happens.

But in the normal weeks, when life isn't as crazy or hectic, it's best to have some plan of action of what to do with your time.

Thanks to Ali Abdaal for the Small Idea.
